Initialize chromosomes with generated initial waveforms

Improve evolution speed:
  Try a better initial population
    Pre-seed waveforms with some likely candidates
      Fundamental frequency + some set of overtones
    Pre-seed song data with some likely candidates
      For each change
        Find the best frequency
        Try each candidate waveform
        Scale to best volume
        Subtract and repeat for other channels

Improve fitness function:
  2) Transform to frequency domain and discard phase information
  3) Weight frequencies psycho-acoustically
  4) Reduce weighting of masked out sounds

Try some different parameters
  Number of waveforms
  Number of samples per waveform
  Number of changes per second
  Huffman coding of change
  Have a field specifying which parameter to change (as in 8088 player)?
