  Pick a random position in the waveform (which may be between samples)
    For initial version, don't use interpolation
  Evaluate the waveform at that position
    Adjust minimum/maximum as necessary
  Increase exposure of nearest pixel to waveform

Use multiple scrollbars for panning

Smooth zooming
