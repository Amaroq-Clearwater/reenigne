How do we deal with the problem that {} can delimit either a compound statement
 or a compound expression?
  If we just try both then we have O(2^N) behavior in the case of N nested {}s.
  Have a "CompoundStatementOrExpression" that can be converted to either
   CompoundStatement or CompoundExpression depending on how it turns out, so
   its contents don't need to be re-parsed when it is converted.

Want to be able to write "offset = (outputSize - inputSize)/2;" in config files
