Need to make TypeList (and hence Type) hashable

How to do function overloading?
  A symbol can be defined as a function or a variable, but not both.
  If it's defined as a function, it can be overloaded.
Add variable declaration statement
Add assignment statement
Add multi-line strings
Add PHP-style string inserts:
  "Hello $name"
  "Hello ${sin(x) + strlen("bar")}"
Add ability to define functions
Add include statement

For String::throwUnexpected(), print name (or hex) of found character to avoid putting unprintable characters in error messages.
Make sure we have a sensible error message when no memory can be allocated at all
