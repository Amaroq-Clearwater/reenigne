Add ability to define functions
  Statement form
  Add compound statements
  Add scopes
    There are two types of scopes (at least), variable scopes and function scopes
    Declaring a variable creates a new variable scope but not a new function scope
    Compound statement create a new function scope as well as a new variable scope
    Types go into the variable scope
Make function call an expression, not a statement
  Make Expression a subclass of Statement
  Add an error when we find an expression statement that has no effect
    Effectful expressions are calls of non-pure functions
Add include statement
Add some more operators
Add some more statements
Add some more types
Allow use of more LValues
Add classes
Add templates
Compile to executable code
                                                                   
Use operator[] instead of lookUp and add in HashTable?
Need a better error message when statement isn't recognized as such
For String::throwUnexpected(), print name (or hex) of found character to avoid putting unprintable characters in error messages.
  Need a way to convert any codepoint into an ASCII printable string
    Use U+xxxx
Make sure we have a sensible error message when no memory can be allocated at all
