Implement TypeList::parse()
How should we deal with built in types?
  Need a class with instances for String, Int, Void etc.
Add assignment statement
Add multi-line strings
Add PHP-style string inserts:
  "Hello $name"
  "Hello ${sin(x) + strlen("bar")}"
Add ability to define functions
Add include statement

Use operator[] instead of lookUp and add in HashTable?

For String::throwUnexpected(), print name (or hex) of found character to avoid putting unprintable characters in error messages.
Make sure we have a sensible error message when no memory can be allocated at all
