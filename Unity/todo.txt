In order to add the function declaration to the scope, we first need to resolve the argument types.
  1) Add all the type definitions (can do this during parsing)
  2) Resolve all the type references (during compile())
  3) Add the function definitions and variable definitions (during compile())
  4) Resolve all the function definitions and variable definitions (second compilation phase needed?)

Add scopes
  There are two types of scopes (at least), variable scopes and function scopes
  Declaring a variable creates a new variable scope but not a new function scope
  Compound statement and function create a new function scope as well as a new variable scope
  Types go into the function scope

Add a FunctionScope class


Imported functions
  How to set up the stack for these in the interpreter?

Pop function arguments into local variables

Add include statement
Add some more operators
Add some more statements
Add some more types
Allow use of more LValues
Add classes
Add templates
Compile to executable code

Use operator[] instead of lookUp and add in HashTable?
Need a better error message when statement isn't recognized as such
For String::throwUnexpected(), print name (or hex) of found character to avoid putting unprintable characters in error messages.
  Need a way to convert any codepoint into an ASCII printable string
    Use U+xxxx
Make sure we have a sensible error message when no memory can be allocated at all
