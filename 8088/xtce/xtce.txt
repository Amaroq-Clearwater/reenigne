Don't try to do cycle-exact emulation on the XT.
  Therefore our testcases will contain expected timings for each instruction list

Modern program:
  Generate a sequence of instructions
    Initially random, later systematic
  Figure out timing
  Add data to XT program
  Run XT program

XT program:
  Do
