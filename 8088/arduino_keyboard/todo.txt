Write a serial send program so we don't have to reprogram Arduino every time we want to change tester program
Avoid sending any keystrokes for 1/4 second after reset - do the wait on an async timer to avoid blocking
Write XT code for sending data - interrupt routine so the calling code can find it easily
  Lower clock line for a length of time longer than a keystroke and shorter than a reset
  Throw away the next keystroke received (it comes from clearInterrupted)
  Receive "clear to send" - if we didn't, try again (should never happen?)
  Receive a keystroke - this is the number of bytes we can send.
  Send number of bytes we're going to send
    Lower clock line
    Raise clock line - timing starts from the moment it's raised
    Send bits
  Send the bytes
  Figure out timing of receiveKeyboardByte()
Write XT kernel code
Write BASIC and DEBUG bootstrapping code
Write host programs
  Virtual keyboard
  Kernel interface - command line
    Send a program, execute it, wait for it to finish, get data back
Shorten delay to send keystrokes faster? 74LS322 is supposed to be good to 25MHz, but U21 limits us to maybe 1 or 0.5.
