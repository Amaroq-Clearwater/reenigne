After first reset, BIOS is sending a second reset but arduino is detecting a "request send", causing it to send FF, causing the BIOS to think there's a stuck key.

Build kernel.asm
Test kernel.asm with some simple programs
Check timings of "here: loop here" delay loops - check that 281 gives 1ms
Add per-bit delays in receiveKeyboardByte() - check that the tolerance is good enough
Add per-byte delay in sendByte for serial
Write BASIC and DEBUG bootstrapping code
Write host programs
  run
    Kernel interface - command line
    Send a program, execute it, wait for it to finish, get data back, end with ^Z
Shorten delay to send keystrokes faster? 74LS322 is supposed to be good to 25MHz, but U21 limits us to maybe 1 or 0.5.
  Can increase baud rate as well if we're waiting around too much
Avoid sending any keystrokes for 1/4 second after reset - do the wait on an async timer to avoid blocking
