quickboot -> host data stream
     0 = escape = ransfer following byte directly, don't interpret it as an action.
     1 = Take screenshot
     2 = Start recording audio
     3 = Stop recording audio
     4 = Transfer file
     5 = Host interrupt, followed by 18 bytes hostBytes as below, followed by payload data (if any). Host then sends result data (for read) and resultBytes.
  0x1a = disconnect host
others = send literal byte to user

hostBytes
  0 = 0x13                               interrupt number
  1 = sector count                       AL
  2 = operation                          AH
  3 = sector/track                       CH
  4 = track                              CL
  5 = drive                              DL
  6 = head                               DH
  7 = step rate time / head unload time  DBT byte 0
  8 = head load time / DMA mode          DBT byte 1
  9 = motor shutoff time                 DBT byte 2
 10 = sector size shift                  DBT byte 3
 11 = sectors per track                  DBT byte 4
 12 = gap length for read/write/verify   DBT byte 5
 13 = data length                        DBT byte 6
 14 = gap length for format              DBT byte 7
 15 = fill byte for format               DBT byte 8
 16 = head settle time                   DBT byte 9
 17 = motor startup time                 DBT byte 0x0a

file states:
  0 = No file operation in progress - output to HTTP
  1 = Get first byte of size
  2 = Get second byte of size
  3 = Get third byte of size
  4 = Get file data
  5 = Get host interrupt data
  6 = Get disk data


Operation must be 2 (read), 3 (write), 4 (verify) or 5 (format) - operations 0 (reset) and 1 (status) are done entirely on the XT
The read block and resultBytes block are sent using the normal loadSerialData routine, so are checksummed and

resultBytes
  0 = returned AL
  1 = returned AH = status byte
  2 = returned flags

status byte:
	   00  no error
	   01  bad command passed to driver
	   02  address mark not found or bad sector   - MA in ST1
	   03  diskette write protect error           - NW in ST1
	   04  sector not found                       - EN in ST1 or ND in ST1
	   08  DMA overrun                            - OR in ST1
	   09  DMA access across 64k boundary         - carry set by DMA_SETUP
	   10  ECC/CRC error on disk read             - DE in ST1
	   20  controller error (NEC for floppies)    - ST0 & 0xc0 != 0
	   40  seek failure                           - ST0 & 0x60 == 0x60 in seek
	   80  time out, drive not ready              - wait for interrupt or result took too long
