quickboot -> host data stream
     0 = escape = ransfer following byte directly, don't interpret it as an action.
     1 = Take screenshot
     2 = Start recording audio
     3 = Stop recording audio
     4 = Transfer file
     5 = Host interrupt, followed by 18 bytes hostBytes as below, followed by payload data (if any). Host then sends result data (for read) and resultBytes.
  0x1a = disconnect host
others = send literal byte to user

hostBytes
  0 = 0x13                               interrupt number
  1 = sector count                       AL
  2 = operation                          AH
  3 = sector/track                       CH
  4 = track                              CL
  5 = drive                              DL
  6 = head                               DH
  7 = step rate time / head unload time  DBT byte 0
  8 = head load time / DMA mode          DBT byte 1
  9 = motor shutoff time                 DBT byte 2
 10 = sector size shift                  DBT byte 3
 11 = sectors per track                  DBT byte 4
 12 = gap length for read/write/verify   DBT byte 5
 13 = data length                        DBT byte 6
 14 = gap length for format              DBT byte 7
 15 = fill byte for format               DBT byte 8
 16 = head settle time                   DBT byte 9
 17 = motor startup time                 DBT byte 0x0a

file states:
  0 = No file operation in progress - output to HTTP
  1 = Get first byte of size
  2 = Get second byte of size
  3 = Get third byte of size
  4 = Get file data
  5 = Get host interrupt data
  6 = Get disk data


Operation must be 2 (read), 3 (write), 4 (verify) or 5 (format) - operations 0 (reset) and 1 (status) are done entirely on the XT
The read block and resultBytes block are sent using the normal loadSerialData routine, so are checksummed and

resultBytes
  0 = returned AL
  1 = returned AH = status byte
  2 = returned flags

status byte:
	   00  no error
	   01  bad command passed to driver
	   02  address mark not found or bad sector
	   03  diskette write protect error
	   04  sector not found
	   08  DMA overrun
	   09  DMA access across 64k boundary
	   10  ECC/CRC error on disk read
	   20  controller error (NEC for floppies)
	   40  seek failure
	   80  time out, drive not ready
