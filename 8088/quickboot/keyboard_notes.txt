XT BIOS resets keyboard by:
  0x08 -> port B
  wait 20ms
  0xc8 -> port B

XT BIOS acks keyboard byte by:
  0xcc -> port B
  0x4c -> port B

B7 clear keyboard
 7	clear keyboard (only pulse, normally kept at 0)    XT? 048?       clear keyboard

B6 hold keyboard clock low
6	=0  hold keyboard clock low                                       hold keyboard clock low


On system board, Clock signal from port is inverted, delayed by 2 PCLKs (1 IO) and passed to pin 11 of shift register
pin 11 rising shifts in new data
=> keyboard clock falling shifts in new data
This gels with the current code in sendKeyboardBit - we load the data, wait 50us, lower the clock, wait 50us and then raise the clock again

Data select is always high so new data always comes in on D1 (pin 17 - connected to keyboard data via 47pF to GND, 4.7K to +5V, pin 8 of U68 and pin 3 of U85)


sendKeyboardByte does:
  (implicitly - check that clock line is high)
  wait for data line high (XT's flow control)
  send 0
  send 1
  send 8 bits of data


74LS74 function table:

PR  CLR  CLK  D  |  Q  -Q
4    1    3   2  |  5   6
                 |
L    H    -   -  |  H   L
H    L    -   -  |  L   H
L    L    -   -  |  H   H  (unstable - does not persist when either PR and/or CLR return to H)
H    H    ^   H  |  H   L
H    H    ^   L  |  L   H
H    H    L   -  |  Q0 -Q0


In the U70 configuration, PR = -Q so:
                  IRQ1
PR  CLR  CLK  D  |  Q  -Q
4    1    3   2  |  5   6
                 |
L    H    -   -  |  H   L
H    L    -   -  |  L   H
H    H    ^   L  |  L   H
H    H    L   -  |  Q0 -Q0

Keyboard data is forced low when U70 pin 6 is low
  This happens when PR (pin 4) goes low which happens when pin 6 is low (so this is a self-reinforcing condition until CLR goes low)
  This also happens when we get a high on D combined with CLK rising. D is connected to U27.12


U27:
  QA..QH (4, 16, 5, 15, 6, 14, 7, 13) are data output to PPI port A (IO port 0x60)  - QA is A7, QH is A0
  -OE (8) is connected to PPI port B7 (clear keyboard pulse) - OUTPUT ENABLE
  D1 (17) is connected to keyboard data
  -CLR (9) is NOT B7 - CLEAR
  CLOCK (11) is delayed keyboard clock
  -G (1) is IRQ1 (U70.5) - REGISTER ENABLE
  -QH' (12) is U70.2 - needs to go high once full byte received

  D0 (3) is +5V
  -SE (18) is +5V - SIGN EXTEND
  DS (19) is +5V - DATA SELECT
  S/-P (2) is +5V - Serial/-Parallel

When the output enable is high, the eight input/output terminals are disabled to the high-impedance state; however, sequential operation or clearing of the register is not affected.

QA is most recent and highest
QH is least recent and lowest
=> Lowest bit first

00000000
00000000  initial zero sent
10000000  initial 1 sent
h1000000  lowest bit sent
gh100000
fgh10000
efgh1000
defgh100
cdefgh10
bcdefgh1  bit 6 sent -> QH' will still be 0 when U70 latches data
abcdefgh  bit 7 sent -> QH' will be 1 when U70 latches data => IRQ1

So algorithm for clock rising interrupt:
  shift data byte right 1 and save shifted out bit
  Load data from keyboard data line and put in highest bit of data
  If the shifted out bit was 1 then send data to XT and clear data byte
