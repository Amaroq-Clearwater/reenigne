Lockstep
by
CRTC
(The Cathode Ray Tube Controllers)
A computer demonstration program
for the IBM PC 5150 and XT 5160
with genuine IBM CGA

4.77MHz = 105/22

Apparently this is possible

We will control the horizontal.
We will control the vertical.
We can roll the image, make it flutter.
We can change the focus to a soft blur
Or sharpen it to crystal clarity.

This demo takes exactly 2,000,000,000 CPU cycles to run
(after CPU, CGA, PIT and CRTC are all in running in lockstep).
People have counted cycles before.
But nobody has ever counted them *all* before.

In order to test this demo and make sure
it wouldn't burn out any flyback transformers,
we had to make our own emulator.
No other emulator was accurate enough.

This is not code for the timid!

Once you have tried every trick in the book,
you have to start writing your own book.
