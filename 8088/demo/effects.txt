    Chunky pixel:
      Effects based on static screen-to-texture lookup tables
        Texture-mapped tunnels and other objects rotating around their axis of symmetry
        Wobblers, rotators and other similar effects for 2D images
        Objects that reflect or refract underlying bitmap images
      Texture-mapped tunnel with freely moving camera, typically based on realtime raytracing
      Rotozoomer
      Mandelbrot zoomer
      Fire effect and other effects based on 2D filters and feedback
