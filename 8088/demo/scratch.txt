With 270 waveforms, sounds pretty bad...
  Try using the GA encoder instead, if we can get it to work

If band-limited interpolation from the 1MHz SID output sounds odd, try resampling some known-good 1MHz data (from a simple upsampling?)

Use different sets of waveforms for different sections?
  Multiple waveform segments implies multiple code and data segments

6*50 changes per second => ~400Kb
  Will need a way to change SS when SP reaches the end - use alternate looptops for this
  Encode so it takes only a few Kb on disk and then decompress on load
    Use Hubbard encoding? Or just zip?

Instead of disabling interrupts, leave keyboard interrupts enabled and just disable timer interrupt (using PIC)
  Allow escape to end song, skip backwards and forwards. Any other controls where we don't mind clicks?
