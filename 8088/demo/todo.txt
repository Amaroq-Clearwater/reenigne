Reduce number of waveforms:
  Whenever we add a waveform, compute distance between this waveform and all others
    Sum of square of differences
  Set a delta below which two waveforms will be considered equivalent
    re-use old waveform if below this delta
    Tweak delta until number of waveforms is low enough
    See how it sounds

Try band-limited interpolation from the 1MHz SID output and see how that sounds
  If it sounds odd, try resampling some known-good 1MHz data (from a simple upsampling?)

See what resampling from 1-bit PWM 1.193MHz sounds like to get an idea of whine in demo

Get DirectSoundSink and WaveOutSink working

Use different sets of waveforms for different sections?
  Multiple waveform segments implies multiple code and data segments

6*50 changes per second => ~400Kb
  Will need a way to change SS when SP reaches the end - use alternate looptops for this
  Encode so it takes only a few Kb on disk and then decompress on load
    Use Hubbard encoding? Or just zip?

Instead of disabling interrupts, leave keyboard interrupts enabled and just disable timer interrupt (using PIC)
  Allow escape to end song, skip backwards and forwards. Any other controls where we don't mind clicks?
