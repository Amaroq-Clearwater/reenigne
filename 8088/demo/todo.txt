Write my own SID simulator that takes this data as input
  Write it as a Source and plug it into the audio Sink
    Just use nearest neighbour interpolation like sidplay currently does for now
    Once that's working try band-limited interpolation from the 1MHz SID output and see how that sounds
      If it sounds odd, try resampling some known-good 1MHz data (from a simple upsampling?)
    See what resampling from 1-bit PWM 1.193MHz sounds like to get an idea of whine in demo
    Try generating 256-element waveforms and change lists instead of sound
      We'll have too many waveforms to begin with - write code to combine them
Port of c64mp3?
  Need to find a suitable piece of music
