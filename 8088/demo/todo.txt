Write my own SID simulator that takes this data as input
  Find out why no sound is being generated
    Try wave writer?
  Check that we don't use any frequencies too low for our player
  Write it as a Source and plug it into the audio Sink
    Just use nearest neighbour interpolation like sidplay currently does for now
    Once that's working try band-limited interpolation from the 1MHz SID output and see how that sounds
      If it sounds odd, try resampling some known-good 1MHz data (from a simple upsampling?)
    See what resampling from 1-bit PWM 1.193MHz sounds like to get an idea of whine in demo
    Try generating 256-element waveforms and change lists instead of sound
      We'll have too many waveforms to begin with - write code to combine them

  Use a genetic algorithm to evolve a solution for a given piece of music
    Can use breeding genomes method
    Fitness function:
      1) Sum of squared samplewise differences
      2) Transform to frequency domain and discard phase information
      3) Weight frequencies psycho-acoustically
      4) Reduce weighting of masked out sounds
    Initially try at 44100Hz, 16-bit
      44100Hz : steps of .67Hz
      Change every 256 samples gives 172 changes per second
        3 channels gives 57 changes per second
        Change each parameter at regular intervals or have a field specifying which parameter to change (as in x86 player)?
        Separate volume parameter?
        1 change = 3 bytes:
          1 byte: waveform
          2 bytes: frequency
        517 bytes per second == 4Kbits/sec == 121Kb for a 4 minute song

      For compression purposes, try some different parameters:
        Number of waveforms
        Number of samples per waveform
        Number of changes per second
        Huffman coding of change
