Need to fit all effects in <720Kb - 2x360Kb floppy
  Expect to use compression, but can't spend too long on decompression.
  Can we use trackmo techniques to load data for next effect while one is playing?
    Interrupts would break lockstep - can we just start it and then expect it to finish within a certain time?

Should we make it a booter or a DOS executable?
  Booter is a bit more work but gives us more memory space and disk space
  Save 6Kb per disk on boot/FAT/root

Any given effect needs to fit in 640Kb
  How much RAM for DOS/BIOS? Seems to be 0xc200 bytes with DOS 3.2


2,000,000,000 cycles == 419 seconds = 6 minutes, 59 seconds
 = 1760 bytes per second

maybe 21 effects at 20 seconds per effect, 35Kb compressed per effect?
