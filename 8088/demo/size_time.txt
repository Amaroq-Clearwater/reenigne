Need to fit all effects in 1MB - 2x360Kb floppy
  Expect to use compression, but can't spend too long on decompression.
  Can we use trackmo techniques to load data for next effect while one is playing?
    Interrupts would break lockstep - can we just start it and then expect it to finish within a certain time?

Should we make it a booter or a DOS executable?
  Booter is a bit more work but gives us more memory space and disk space
  Save 6Kb per disk on boot/FAT/root

Any given effect needs to fit in 640Kb
  How much RAM for DOS/BIOS? Seems to be 0xc200 bytes with DOS 3.2


2,000,000,000 cycles == 419 seconds = 6 minutes, 59 seconds
 = 1760 bytes per second

maybe 21 effects at 20 seconds per effect, 35Kb compressed per effect?

25600 bytes/sec == ~7.8% of time reading disk = 1.5s per effect

Use a general compressor - DEFLATE?
  Lots of implementations listed at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEFLATE
    Compare zlib deflate and puff
  Or use arithmetic coding like kkrunchy? Better compression but might be slower.




2,147,483,648 cycles = 449 seconds = 7 minutes, 29 seconds
 = 2330 bytes per second

32 effects at 14 seconds per effect, 32KB compressed data per effect?

Or 21 effects at 48KB compressed data per effect (4 tracks)?
