VTA are counted normally, not halved like the rest
vsync output from CRTC starts/ends on character 0/57
  vsync output from CGA starts/ends on character 90 or 100
So for even page, vsync is delayed by half a scanline and starts on scanline 240 as normal
For odd page, vsync is delayed by a whole scanline?
Why do we need 3 pages?
  displayPage is the page currently being displayed, set in the interrupt
  setPage is the page that was last passed to setDisplayPage() (set there)
  nextPage is the page that will become the new displayPage once the next full frame is complete

setDisplayPage called
  Drawing is now disallowed                                sequence = 2
(if scanline >=238, wait for scanline 0)
  we are now on the last frame of the old page
  Drawing is now allowed if scanline >= 200                sequence = 1
set CRTC for 262-scanline field
wait for scanline 0 again
  we are now on the new page
  Drawing is now allowed                                   sequence = 0
set CRTC for 240-scanline field
  we can now call setDisplayPage again

We'd like to be able to call setDisplayPage() at any time that drawing is allowed
  Then we might have: (with 200 <= scanline < 262)
    displayPage = 0 (the one that we recently finished displaying)
    nextPage = 1 (the one that will be the display page once the upcoming 262-scanline field is finished)
    setPage = 0 (the one we just set)
  In this case, we need another bit of information to
