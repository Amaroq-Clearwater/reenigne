How many changes per second should we have? (1 change = 4 bytes)
  If we want to allow changing the sample and velocity for each of 4 channels in each division, need 8 changes (32 bytes) per division
  6 ticks per division = 32*50/6 = 267 bytes per second = 16000 bytes per minute
    8*50/6 = 66.6 changes per second
    CX =  437500/33/66.6 = 198
  1 tick per division = 96000 bytes per minute

6 ticks per division initially == 125 beats per minute
4 divisions per beat
16 divisions per pattern

6 ticks/division = 125 beats/minute
24 ticks/beat = 125 beats/minute = 1/125 minutes/beat

ticks per minute = 24*125 = 3000
ticks per second = 50


Implement effects as they are needed
For better quality later, implement one voice as unscaled longer samples
