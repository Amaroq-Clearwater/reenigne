Allow array types in config files
  Allow "size={200,150};" syntax for structures and arrays
    Type of {x,y} is Tuple<X,Y>.
    Give structures constructors taking a tuple of their member types

Array::allocate() doesn't construct which is error prone. Figure out a better
  interface. Why doesn't it construct?

See if we can get rid of some Array::allocate() calls with the new constructor

ConfigFile
  Allow elements of structured values as values
  Make boolean a built-in enumeration
  Operators are unwieldy - keep a list of allowed overloads?
    Add toString methods
    Allow function calls?

Fix up coloured border
  Always make output 640x200 centered

Get RGB version working again, and see what the output looks like on composite
  Try with both sRGB and perceptual

Use linear space for error diffusion but perceptual space for choosing the
  smallest error.
    Diffuse error across entire next block?

Handle PNG formats other than 24-bit sRGB:
  1, 2, 4, 16 bits per channel?
  Monochrome
  Gamma

Try all 6 possibilites for overscanColour in AttributeClashImage constructor.
  Try black as well for monochrome images
    Also for monochrome try +BW, which is not the same
Make brightness, contrast, saturation and tint user-settable
  Knobs?
Have multiple windows: RGB output, NTSC output
Refactor CalcThread with CalcThread in fractal.h as EndableThread?
  Make a BackgroundCalculationImage base class?
Output image scaling
  Scanlines
    DirectX?
Use libpng for input and output
Test for repeated iterations
Fix RGB output for -HRES
Add a Vector size for Windows::Params constructor
