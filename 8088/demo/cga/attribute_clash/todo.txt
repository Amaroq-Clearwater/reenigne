Pixels are all black
Some colours are wrong
Error not being diffused

Try all 6 possibilites for overscanColour in AttributeClashImage constructor.
  Try black as well for monochrome images
    Also for monochrome try +BW, which is not the same
Try 90+33 for tint instead of 103+18
Make brightness, contrast, saturation and tint user-settable
Refactor CalcThread with CalcThread in fractal.h as EndableThread?
  Make a BackgroundCalculationImage base class?
Output image scaling
Handle both +HRES and -HRES
  -HRES doesn't need coloured border
