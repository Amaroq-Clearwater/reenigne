Colour schemes:
  * 4 bars, colours 1, 2, 4 and 8 - ORed together where they pass through each other
  * Opaque Z-buffered circular cylinders
    * Solid colours
    * Colour schemes like 4, 6, 14, 15, 11, 9, 1 - scaled pointwise
    * Phong-shaded dithered circles
      * Hue, light angle and size can be changed arbitrarily
    * Shadows?

Motion patterns:
  * N bars moving in a circle
    * Only taking up part of the circle
      * Moving the center of that circle in a circle
  * Braids
    * Plait^N
      * Fractal?
    * Sine waves
  * Size inversely proportional to distance
  * Bars at lattice points, rotate around lattice (like 2D NaCl).
