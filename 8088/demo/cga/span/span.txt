World coordinates: 8.8   -128 <= model.x < 128
Matrix elements: 8.8     -128 <= _xx < 128
r.x and r.y: 16.16       -32768 <= r.x < 32768
r.z: 0 8.16              -128 <= r.z < 128

In current span, the s vector is 338, 282, 0.566
So the matrix elements won't fit in 8.8
  This just means that the model and screen need to be larger by at least a factor of 3
    Making the screen 4x3 in world units is quite nice!

The transformed (screen) coordinates should be accurate to 1/256 of pixel width
However, we want to allow for vertex positions which are a long way offscreen (e.g. above player)
Therefore, pre-clipping we want screen positions in 24.8 format
  Or 12.4?

Suppose transformed coordinates are in 16.16 format.

To compute 16.16 / 16.16, need to shift quotient rep left by x bits and divisor right by 16-x bits
  So could be a 48/32 division or a 32/16
  Latter would be much faster!
  This is x/(z >> 16) - i.e. drop fractional part of z
  However, we only want 8 fractional bits for fillTriangle, so we need a >>8
    So we could compute:
      (x >> 8)/(z >> 16) - 32/16 (really 24/16)
      x/(z >> 8) - 32/24 (can compute as 32/16 if -128 <= r.z < 128)
  We do need the transform output to be 16.8 or 24.8 in order to do clipping properly
    So use 32/16->32, which is two 32/16->16 operations
      xor dx,dx
      mov cx,[rz + 1]
      mov ax,[rx + 2]
      idiv cx          ; dx = remainder, ax = quotient
      mov [sx + 2],ax
      mov ax,[rx]
      idiv cx
      mov [sx],ax




For fillTriangle, we want a 24.8 result - i.e. vR = rR*2^-8

We have vX = rX*2^-16 and vZ = rZ*2^-16

vR = vX/vZ

rR*2^-8 = rX / rZ
rR = rX*2^8 / rZ

Suppose we want to compute this with a 32/16 divide



Suppose we have rX in DX:AX and rZ in BX:CX

(6*100*s/5) * 5 = 128  s = 0.21333  2/s = size of screen vertically in world coords = 9.375
size of screen horizontally = 10
this is with distance = 5 which is a very wide field of vision
  For a PC game, a 90 degree FoV is normal, i.e. distance = 128 pixels



Express FoV as distance in units of screen width (d/sx)
  FoV of 90 degrees is d/sx = 0.5 = ds    d = ds*sx     sx = d/ds

sx/sy = (5/6)*(256/200) = 1.06666     sx = 1.06666*sy   sy = 0.9375*sx
1/zs = sy/2      zs = 2/sy   sy = 2/zs
ys = 100*zs      zs = ys/100
xs = 6*ys/5      5*xs/6 = ys
xs*d = 128       xs = 128/d


sy = 2/zs = 2/(ys/100) = 200/ys     = pixels per world-unit vertically
sy = 200/(5*xs/6) = 200/(5*(128/d)/6) = 200/(5*(128/(ds*sx))/6) = 200/(5*(128/(ds*(1.06666*sy)))/6)

1/2 = ds


maximum matrix value = xs*d = 6*ys*d/5 = 6*100*(2/sy)*d/5  = 6*100*(2/(0.9375*(d/ds)))*d/5 = 256*ds

Want zs = 1 so sy = 2 and sx = 2.13333333
ys = 100
xs = 120
d = 1.06666


Modify distance to satisfy xs*d = 128

d = 128/xs = 128/(6*ys/5) = 128/(6*(100*zs)/5) = 128/(6*(100*(d/sqrt((d*d + 1)*3)))/5)

d*d = 1.066666666*sqrt((d*d + 1)*3)

d^4 = 1.066666^2 * (d*d + 1)*3

d = 128/(6*(100*(d/sqrt((d*d + 1)*3)))/5)

d = (4/5)*sqrt((8/3) + sqrt(139)/3) = 2.0547091212166765333819588893295

With ys = 99.5*zs, d = 2.06338

As sine table values are essentially 8 bits plus a sign bit, can we use table-of-squares to do the multiply?

(0x100*a + b)*c = (b*c) + 0x100*(a*c)

Is it better to include the world-to-pixel scaling factors into the transformation matrix or apply them separately afterwards?
  Applying them separately doesn't seem to buy us anything, unless we can do crazy optimizations to eliminate the first mul (store separate sine table for each possible world position)
    world (8.8) * rotation (1.8) >> 8 -> rotated (8.8)            imul
    rotated (8.8) <<8 / z (8.8) -> transformed (24.8)          idiv idiv    need 32 bits of precision after perspective applied
    transformed (24.8) * scale (8.8) -> scaled (16.16)            imul

  Applying them together:
    world (8.8) * matrix (8.8) -> worldpix (16.16)   imul
    scaled (16.16) / z (8.8) -> screen (24.8)        idiv idiv
