Startup:
  1) Wait until we're sure that no keys are being pressed.
  2) Disable interrupts
  3) Disable video output, +HRES
  4) Program the CRTC for 1 char x 1 scanline x 1 row, no sync pulses
  5) Put the CPU in lockstep with the DRAM refresh using MULs
  6) Wait for a DRAM refresh
  7) Access CGA RAM to put us in lockstep with the CGA character clock
  8) Reset DRAM refresh. Lockstep is now acheived as long as we don't wait for any external interrupts (keyboard, disk).
  9) Reprogram CRTC.
