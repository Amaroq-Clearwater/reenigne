Startup:
  1) Set CRTC to use +HRES
  2) Set CRTC R0=0, R4=1, R5=0, R9=0
  3) Disable interrupts and turn off DRAM refresh
  4) Use "stosb" to CGA memory and MULs to go into lockstep with the CGA. Lockstep is now acheived as long as we don't wait for any external interrupts (keyboard, disk).
  5) Wait until we're sure CRTC has started new frame
  6) Reprogram CRTC.
