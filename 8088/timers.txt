memtimer/memtimer is probably the one you want - it outputs "number of CPU cycles" +"number of extra timer ticks over 480 iterations"
memtimer/onetimer is if you want to time a piece of code that only runs once (i.e. a loop)
mintimer is used for the multiplication timings - same experiment with lots of different parameters patched in
memtimer/mtd is a DOS port of memtimer/memtimer

When timing something that takes more than 546 +016, add multiples of this amount to measured result
