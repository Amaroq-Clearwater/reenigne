Timer 1 output is 8253+OUT1
  This is connected to a flip-flop: DRQ0 goes high when 8253+OUT1 goes high and low when -DACK0BRD goes low.

DRQ0 goes to the 8237
  8237 starts in SI
  8237 signals CPU that it needs to start a refresh, goes into S0
  8237 received HLDA from the CPU
  8237 goes into S1
  8237 goes into S2
  8237 goes into S3
  8237 goes into S4

8237 is clocked by DCLK which is CLK88 with a width of 7ns.



1 DMA refresh every 15.086 us
Strobe through 128 rows in 1.931ms, 256 rows in 3.862ms
Strobe through all 64Kb in just under 1 second.

1 cycle of 4.77MHz is ~210ns.

DMA initialization:
Channel 0 word count (0x01) = 0xff
Channel 0 word count (0x01) = 0xff
Mode (0x0b) = 0x58                 Mode for channel 0 = read transfer, autoinitialization enable, address increment select, single mode select
Command (0x08) = 0                 Command = memory-to-memory disable, channel 0 address hold disable, controller enable, normal timing, fixed priority, late write selection, DREQ sense active high, DACK sense active low
Mask (0x0a) = 0                    Mask for channel 0 = 0 - enabled
Mode (0x0b) = 0x41                 Mode for channel 1 = verify transfer, autoinitialzation disable, address increment select, single mode select
Mode (0x0b) = 0x42                 Mode for channel 2 = verify transfer, autoinitialzation disable, address increment select, single mode select
Mode (0x0b) = 0x43                 Mode for channel 3 = verify transfer, autoinitialzation disable, address increment select, single mode select

Port 083 is High order 4 bits of DMA channel 1,0 address  <- set to 0 on bootup. So this won't refresh the CGA RAM.
