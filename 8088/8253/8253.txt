When we use the latch command on a channel, it does not affect the mode
The data returned by the latch command depends on the last write command, it's not both bytes always
Writing LSB only clears MSB
Writing MSB only clears LSB
Datasheet and defaults_common.asm are correct about meaning of byte select bits - http://stanislavs.org/helppc/8253.html is wrong
