From crtc_ma we learn:
  The light pen doesn't depend on the display enable bit being set
  The memory address advances during the vsync period, meaning that the design change mentioned on p17 of the datasheet took place.
  With r4=r5=r9=0, r8=2 we see ma going up to 1438 (242 samples - i.e. we have 128 lines)
  With r4=r9=0, r5=1, r8=2 we see ma going up to 1460 and then repeating - looks like 2 lines and then 1 extra
  With r4=r9=0, r5=31, r8=2 we see ma going up to 1460 and then repeating two rows of 32 (32 and then 31 extra?)
  With r4=r5=r9, r8=0, we see the same as with r8=0
  With r4=r5=r9, r8=1, we see a 2-scanline frame? Same with r8=3

The CRTC's address register isn't changed by a read (so probably not by a write either)

The datasheet says:
  Interlace modes 0 and 2  normal sync               1 field per frame
  Interlace mode 1         interlace sync            2 fields per frame with same information in each field  double density
  Interlace mode 3         interlace sync and video  2 fields per frame with different information           double resolution

If r8 is odd, horizontal character count must be odd (even number of character times)
If r8 is 3, the max scan line address must be odd (even number of scan lines)
If r3 is 3, the vertical displayed total characters must be even and the programmed number must be half of the number actually required
If r8 is 3, the cursor start and cursor end registers must be both even or both odd

Experiments to perform:
  Use lockstep to get some easier to understand results
