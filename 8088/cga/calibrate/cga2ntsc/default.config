//   0x08 = low-resolution text (e.g. 40 columns standard width)
//   0x09 = high-resolution text (e.g. 80 columns standard width)
//   0x0a = 2bpp graphics
//   0x1a = 1bpp graphics
// Improper modes
//   0x0b = high-res 2bpp graphics
//   0x18 = low-resolution text with 1bpp graphics
//   0x19 = high-resolution text with 1bpp graphics
//   0x1b = high-res 1bpp graphics, odd bits ignored
// Add 4 to any of these for to disable colour burst and carrier and use
// red/cyan palette for 2bpp modes.
// Add 0x20 in text modes to enable blinking and disable bright backgrounds.
// cga2ntsc will not use the blink bit - this just prevents it from using
// bright backgrounds.
// The improper modes latch bytes at incorrect times, so have strange bit
// patterns and require multiple passes to get optimal results.
// Use 0x80 for auto -HRES and 0x81 for auto +HRES (tries all combinations).

//   0x00..0x0f = background/green/red/brown
//   0x10..0x1f = background/light green/light red/yellow
//   0x20..0x2f = background/cyan/magenta/light grey

// for the way that data is laid out in RAM), and 3+ give repeated scanlines.
