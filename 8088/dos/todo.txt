8088 DOS
  Ability to use another machine (over serial) as a drive (with very large capacity)
  Ability to control the 8088 via the serial port
  Uses:
    Transferring data to the 8088 whilst minimizing messing with floppies
    Running tests for emulator making
    Launching demos and games
  Use of 115200 bps serial on a 4.77MHz 8088? Polling instead of interrupts required?
    Transmit blocks of 512 bytes (22.5 Hz) and then check for interrupts
      When servicing other interrupts, set RTS/CTS (or DTR/DSR?) to avoid losing bytes

Bootstrapping
  Come up with a typable program (based on my bootstrap compiler) that can receive data from serial and execute it
  If ctty is available, this can be sent from the host
    If not, maybe "copy com1 t.bat"?
      Need "mode" to set baud rate etc.

Make it multi-tasking:
  We should be able to copy a file between serial and disk and still be able to accept keyboard input
  Full-duplex serial should be possible (although can't read and write from a disk at the same time)
  Allow timeslicing of cooperating programs
  Use memory as disk cache - cooperating programs specify how much memory they need

Disk transfer rate:
  300 rpm, 4608 bytes per track gives peak of 23040 bytes/second (probably closer to 12KB/sec on average - 30 seconds to read the whole disk?)
    = 1 byte every ~207 CPU cycles (~52 IO cycles) - slightly less than 3 times the DRAM refresh rate

Serial transfer rate:
  115200 bps, 1 start bit, 1 stop bit = 11520 bytes per second
    = 1 byte every ~414 CPU cycles (~104 IO cycles) - slightly less than 6 times the DRAM refresh rate

Parallel transfer?
  Nybble at a time: output through pins 2/3/4/5, input through pins 10/11/12/13?
    laplink cable - 40-60KB/sec (80-300KB/sec if we have bidirectional 8-bit port)
      Faster than disk!
      Downside is that bootstrapping is more difficult
      Is there a standard protocol? Probably should just make up our own, since we'll be making up a high-level protocol anyway

TODO:
  Write a skeleton kernel dispatch
  Write a serial transfer routine
