MFM inserts a synchronization bit between each pair of bits:
  Bits  synch. bit
  0 0        1
  0 1        0
  1 0        0
  1 1        0

That way, at most 1 one and at most 3 zeroes are written consecutively

A1 is encoded:

0
  1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
 0100010010101001 = 44A9

The MFM synchronization word is:

 0100010010001001
which decodes to A1 but has a sync zero between two data zeroes, so would not occur in normal data.

So, unless we have a proper sector header, we'll not be able to read data reliably (50% of the time we'll get the MFM bits).

1 corresponds to a magnetic flux reversal, 0 corresponds to no reversal.


FM also writes 1 sync bit per data bit, but it's always a 1, so the data rate must be halved because otherwise the density of reversals would be too high.
