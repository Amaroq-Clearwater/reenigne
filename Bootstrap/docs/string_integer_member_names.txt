Allow the members of an object to be referenced by strings and integers as well as identifiers:
  Cannot access directly from member functions, need to precede with "this."
  e.g. :
    type X = class {
      Y "foo";
      Z 1;
      Y bar() { return this."foo"; }
    }
  Strings are useful for parsers (so that the compiler doesn't have to make up names for parts of a type)
  Numbers are useful for fixed-length vectors, e.g. :
    type Quaternion = class {
       Double 0,1,2,3;
    }
