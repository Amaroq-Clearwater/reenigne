Debug stuck lights:
  Doing "029?" reveals that we're getting 1s from D7 (right switches) and both 0s and 1s from D4 (left switches)
    1 means untouched, 0 means touched
      Check for shorts on pin 6 and the Darlington Pair output - test these with audio probe

Try slowing right down and see if it still happens
  Stop completely and check DC voltages

If switches work properly when slowed down, try tinkering with capacitances?

If switches are reading open, does it work properly after fixing up the memory?
  Look into startup sequence to determine how it got in that stage
