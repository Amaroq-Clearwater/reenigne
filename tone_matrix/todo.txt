Debug stuck lights:
  1) Determine if the 4 affected switches are reading closed even after startup
    debug dump switchBuffer (800-900) and switchesTouched (r13)
      recompile debugger.cpp to dump this region, use it

If switches are reading closed, try slowing right down and see if it still happens
  Stop completely and check DC voltages

If switches work properly when slowed down, try tinkering with capacitances?

If switches are reading open, does it work properly after fixing up the memory?
  Look into startup sequence to determine how it got in that stage
