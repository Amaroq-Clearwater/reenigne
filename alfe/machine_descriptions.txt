Assume binary arithmetic
Assume 8-bit bytes
A register is a sequence of contiguous bytes in the register file, or a concatenation of smaller registers
A register class is a set of registers that are interchangeable for some particular instruction pattern, so that a pattern doesn't have to be duplicated for each set of registers it can be used with

What things does the compiler need to know about each instruction pattern?
  Number of register holes
  Class of each register hole
    These two things can be derived dynamically from the holes in the pattern
  How the pattern looks in assembly
  How the pattern is assembled as instruction bytes (and relocations, if targetting an object file format)
