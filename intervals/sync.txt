USync is the one that happens first (before read and initData)

; Return to 3-pin connector
; Synchronize only after a full set of data has been transferred
;   With 3-bit length we always transfer 9 bits at a time (parent low, length low, length middle, length high, child B, child C, child D, switch, more)
;   Parent sends synchronization bit after each word - child loops 0 or 1 times depending on value
; Synchronization unnecessary for prime phase - we just wait for events
; In order to have a predictable delay between request and response, we need to make sure we always have the next word to transmit
;   So we need to read the next word from the child while we're transmitting the current word.
;   Store data using INDF/FSR - we can read from one bit and write to another
; There must be some delay introduced between us being sent data request and us sending data request
; Once data stream is started it always runs to completion with no waits.



; clock speed is +/- 1%
; so we have to tolerate a drift of 2% i.e. 2 cycles over 100.
