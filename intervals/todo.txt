Simplify root.asm
  Get rid of initial write
  Flatten

benchmark
add multiple bars all running at exactly 4MHz and check that we get the right stream back
vary the clock speed according to a normal distribution - gradually increase the standard deviation and see when it breaks
randomly add and remove bars as we're running
  Remove a random bar
    Pick a bar at random
    Figure out if it's a leaf
    Disconnect it
    Remove it
  Add a random bar
    Pick a bar at random
    Pick a port at random - see if it's already connected
    Create a new bar
    Pick a random port of the correct gender
    Connect it

Simulate clock drift, jitter, output settling time

Performance
  Add a "care bits" mask to readMemory() and avoid reading bits we don't need. Use in BTFSC and BTFSS.
  Add an output buffer and only call maleWrite()/femaleWrite() on bits that change.
