Fix "tardy sync chain" problem if possible
  Build and run

Build first interval bar - octave
  Fix up PCB layout
  Print PCB layout
  Iron onto board
  Touch up
  Etch
  Clean
  Drill
  Solder jumpers and programming wires (temporarily)
  Solder PIC

Build programmer
  13V supply and switch

Test programmer

Run speed test
  Try varying the OSCCAL value and see what happens to the speed

Buy connectors and resistors

When the hardware doesn't work:
  Check that MOVWF OSCCAL works correctly when it isn't the first (second) instruction executed
  Get something simpler working
  Run timing tests (make sure MOVWF PCL takes one cycle)
