  Make prime signal less confusable:
    Fix up intervals.annotation

Programmer
  Programming is rather slow
    Use calibration code to test speed of delay loops
  Write back backup OSCCAL to PIC (0xC24)

Buy connectors and resistors

When the hardware doesn't work:
  Get something simpler working
  Run timing tests (make sure MOVWF PCL takes one cycle)
