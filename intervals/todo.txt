Stall in configuration 774430
  Add ability to dump state so that it can be restored once we've got some debugging equipment in place
  ~100 streams per second - only about 26 of the bars are giving data (on average)
    Since stream rate is consistent this is probably due to failure to prime
      Prime not being received - no
      Prime pending not being received?
      Child receiving data request too early?
  Check dump - see if we've got a prime pending timing problem

Programmer
  Why are we losing a character?
  Programming is rather slow
  Write back backup OSCCAL to PIC (0xC24)


Buy connectors and resistors

When the hardware doesn't work:
  Get something simpler working
  Run timing tests (make sure MOVWF PCL takes one cycle)
