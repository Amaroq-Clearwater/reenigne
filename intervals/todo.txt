Stall in configuration 774430
  Only a few markers in matrix - do we have a "waiting for prime" loop?
    Look at dump - see if this is the case.
    How could this happen? We can't change more than one connection whilst there is a prime pending as it won't have settled.

  Why are we losing a character?
  Programming is rather slow
  Write back backup OSCCAL to PIC (0xC24)


Buy connectors and resistors

When the hardware doesn't work:
  Get something simpler working
  Run timing tests (make sure MOVWF PCL takes one cycle)
