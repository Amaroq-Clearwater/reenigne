Programmer
  Write back backup OSCCAL to PIC (0xC24)

  Write code to automatically test speed:
    Put waveform code in buffer
    Loop
      Run timing for 10 cycles
      Compute mean and std dev
      Output over serial: OSCCAL value, Hertz value, Hertz std dev
        000 0987654 +/-
        f = 65536000000 / t     delta t of 1 cycle gives delta f of 65536000000/65535 ~= 15 Hz

Buy connectors and resistors

When the hardware doesn't work:
  Get something simpler working
  Run timing tests (make sure MOVWF PCL takes one cycle)
