Fix up markers in intervals.annotation
Fix up root.annotation

Speed:
  Can we switch back to 4 cycles per bit data?
  Reduce the prime check wait time
    Put a high pause in the middle of the write cycle to reduce the maximum low time during data transfer

Allow connection/disconnection when not in good state

vary the clock speed according to a normal distribution - gradually increase the standard deviation and see when it breaks
  Are the clock speeds of real PIC12F508s normal or uniform?
    Write code for the programmer code and speed tester (ideal speed should be 1/3 MHz)

Make simulator.cpp output diagrams like timings.txt

When the hardware doesn't work:
  Check that MOVWL OSCCAL works correctly when it isn't the first (second) instruction executed
  Get something simpler working
  Run timing tests (make sure MOVWF PCL takes one cycle)
