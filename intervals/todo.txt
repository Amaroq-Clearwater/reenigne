Bad after settling in ~1700
  Look for bad after 500000 cycles of good rather than 10 goods?

Allow connection/disconnection when not in good state

Finish writing code for programmer:
  AVR code
    Transfer program to/from PC
    Speed test host code
  PC code
    Transfer program to/from AVR
  PIC code
    Speed test client code

Buy connectors and resistors

Build first interval bar - octave

Build programmer
  13V supply and switch

Check the speeds of the PICs we have
  Try varying the OSCCAL value and see what happens to the speed

When the hardware doesn't work:
  Check that MOVWF OSCCAL works correctly when it isn't the first (second) instruction executed
  Get something simpler working
  Run timing tests (make sure MOVWF PCL takes one cycle)
