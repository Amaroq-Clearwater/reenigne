Finish writing code for programmer:
  AVR code
    Transfer program to/from PC
      HEX file decoder
    Speed test host code
  PC code
    Transfer program to/from AVR

Buy connectors and resistors

Build first interval bar - octave

Build programmer
  13V supply and switch

Check the speeds of the PICs we have
  Try varying the OSCCAL value and see what happens to the speed

When the hardware doesn't work:
  Check that MOVWF OSCCAL works correctly when it isn't the first (second) instruction executed
  Get something simpler working
  Run timing tests (make sure MOVWF PCL takes one cycle)
