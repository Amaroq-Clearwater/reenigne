Stall in configuration 774430 - a "wait for sync" loop.
  How could this happen? We can't change more than one connection whilst there is a prime pending as it won't have settled.
    Examine 774420+ dump.

Can we eliminate all settling problems by powering off entire chain between streams?
  Do some tests to figure out:
    How long power needs to be low for a reset
    How long it takes to power up after a reset
    Both O(30ms)?
  If powering off each cycle is not feasable, power off if it's clearly stalled:
    Can figure out number of bars by looking at time taken to prime, power off if we get more bytes than this
    Power off if it's taken more streams to settle than there are bars
  If powering off after each cycle is feasable, can get rid of prime waiting period and make things much faster

Programmer
  Programming is rather slow
    Use calibration code to test speed of delay loops
  Write back backup OSCCAL to PIC (0xC24)


Buy connectors and resistors

When the hardware doesn't work:
  Get something simpler working
  Run timing tests (make sure MOVWF PCL takes one cycle)
