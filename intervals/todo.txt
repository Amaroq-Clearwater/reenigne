Figure out why we're getting bad streams

If we have a loop and it gets disconnected just so, we'll get a situation where a bar is live and waiting for a data request from a disconnected direction
  After prime complete signal received, bring line low again and then bring high to signal "data request" instead of low.
    This means we need to do a lot more work to preserve the bit status while we're communicating

To aid debugging, write a short note for each instructions and put these notes in the dump (instead of the instructions?)

vary the clock speed according to a normal distribution - gradually increase the standard deviation and see when it breaks
  Are the clock speeds of real PIC12F508s normal or uniform?
    Write code for the programmer code and speed tester (ideal speed should be 1/3 MHz)
  Might need to rearrange simulateCycle() as simulateToTime()

Simulate clock drift, jitter, output settling time
