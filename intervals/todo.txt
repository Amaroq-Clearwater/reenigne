Stall in configuration 774430 - a "wait for sync" loop.
  How could this happen? We can't change more than one connection whilst there is a prime pending as it won't have settled.
    Examine 774420+ debug dump.
    Data/prime deconfusion not working?

Programmer
  Programming is rather slow
    Use calibration code to test speed of delay loops
  Write back backup OSCCAL to PIC (0xC24)

Buy connectors and resistors

When the hardware doesn't work:
  Get something simpler working
  Run timing tests (make sure MOVWF PCL takes one cycle)
