Investigate glitching states some more?
  Make a one-line per cycle timing display
    100x256 array of counts of:
      (local) cycles since last sync
      bar number
    Sync happens when child set to R.
    Bar becomes active when parent set to 0.
    Output when we reset timers
  The sync pulses seem to be "bunching" - getting closer and closer together as we go further into the graph?
  Have the root back off the pulse rate on bad

Programmer returning error on end-of-file line
  Re-test with error codes

Programmer not putting things in the right places?
  Do an 'L' with the new programmer with preloaded waveform.hex

Build first interval bar - octave
  Break off first piece of PCB
  Break off 164.5mm x 28m piece of PCB
  Fix up PCB layout
  Print PCB layout
  Iron onto board
  Touch up
  Etch
  Clean
  Drill
  Solder jumpers and programming wires (temporarily)
  Solder PIC

Build programmer
  13V supply and switch

Test programmer

Run speed test
  Try varying the OSCCAL value and see what happens to the speed

Buy connectors and resistors

When the hardware doesn't work:
  Check that MOVWF OSCCAL works correctly when it isn't the first (second) instruction executed
  Get something simpler working
  Run timing tests (make sure MOVWF PCL takes one cycle)
