Investigate glitching states some more?
  Failure to sync? Cured by reducing the word rate? (reduced it by 3 since last tried)

Test programmer

Build first interval bar - octave

Run speed test

Buy connectors and resistors

Build programmer
  13V supply and switch

Check the speeds of the PICs we have
  Try varying the OSCCAL value and see what happens to the speed

When the hardware doesn't work:
  Check that MOVWF OSCCAL works correctly when it isn't the first (second) instruction executed
  Get something simpler working
  Run timing tests (make sure MOVWF PCL takes one cycle)
